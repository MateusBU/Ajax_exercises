## Ajax Study Exercises

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique that allows web pages to update parts of their content without reloading the whole page.
It works by sending asynchronous HTTP requests to the server and handling the response dynamically using JavaScript.
This results in faster, more interactive, and smoother user experiences on websites.
